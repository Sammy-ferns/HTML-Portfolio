<h1>Samara's favourite series</h1>
<h2>My top 3 series of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>It's always sunny in Philadelphia</h3>
<p>The best dark humour show to exist. It's like Seinfeld on crack.</p>
<h3>Curb your enthusiasm</h3>
<p>Admit it, we all want to be like Larry David and call people out of their woke bs.</p>
<h3>The Office</h3>
<p>Who does'nt love some Michael Scott.</p>
